    <Prompt ref="DetectIrrelevantQueryPrompt">
      <promptString>
        The user is querying the site {request.site} which has information about {site.itemType}s.
        Is the site utterly completely irrelevant to the user's query? 
        The question is not whether this is the best site for answering the query, 
        but if there is nothing on the site that is likely to be relevant for the query. 
        If the site is irrelevant, add an explanation for why it is irrelevant. Otherwise, leave that field blank.
        The user query is: '{request.query}'

      <promptString>
        The user is querying the site {request.site} which has {site.itemType}s.
        Rewrite the query, incorporating the context of the previous queries and answers.
        Keep the decontextualized query short and do not reference the site. 

        If the query very clearly does not reference earlier queries, 
        don't change the query. Err on the side of incorporating the context of the 
        previous queries. If you are not sure whether this is a brand new query, 
        or follow up, it is likely a follow up. Try your best to incorporate the 
        context from the previous queries.

    <Prompt ref="QueryRewrite">
      <promptString>
        You are helping to rewrite a complex search query into simpler keyword queries for a traditional keyword-based search engine.
        The search engine works best with short, focused queries containing important keywords.
        
        Take the following query and break it down into up to 5 simpler search queries.
        Each query should:
        - Contain no more than 3 words
        - Focus on the most important keywords and concepts
        - Be diverse to cover different aspects of the original query
        - Use only essential nouns, adjectives, or product terms
        - Avoid common words like "for", "the", "some", "are", "that", "would", "be"
        
        For example:
        - "what are some options for plates that would be appropriate for serving vegetables" → ["vegetable plates", "serving plates", "dinner plates", "salad plates", "ceramic plates"]
        - "looking for a tea pot that can brew green tea" → ["tea pot", "green tea", "teapot ceramic", "japanese teapot", "brewing pot"]
        
        The original query is: {request.query}
